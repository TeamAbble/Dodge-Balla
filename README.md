# Dodge Balla 
## A 3D Multiplayer Party Game

### Introduction
Dodge balla is a 3D Online Multiplayer game that I am developing in Unity.  
In this game you will pick up bombs and throw them at your opponents to score points.  
The player with the most points at the end of the game will win.  
The game will feature several maps that the players can battle on, some potentially featuring their own unique gimmicks.  

### Controls
WASD - Move 
Mouse Move - Look 
Grab - E 
Throw - Left Mouse Button
Jump - Space

### How To Install  
Currently there are no public builds for the game, so the only way to play it is to open it with Unity.  
Install the game by cloning the repository.  
Open Unity Hub and navigate to the Add project from disk option.  
In the file explorer, navigate to the games project folder.  
Click add, this will then prompt you to install the correct Unity version 
> (vers 6000.0.32f)
Once installed, open the project.

### Playing the game
Once open, navigate to the Window > Multiplayer > Multiplayer Play Mode. This will add the Multiplayer Play Mode panel to your inspector. 
From here you can activate up to 3 extra players.  
Now, start play mode from the Editor.  

Once in the game, you can press start, then host on one of your players, then start > join on your other players.  
On the host, you can then choose a map, currently there is only one option for a map, Balla Desert. Selecting this map will load the game.
